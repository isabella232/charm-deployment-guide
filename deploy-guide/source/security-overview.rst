Security overview

This Security section includes topics related to authentication and
authorisation in Charmed OpenStack.

.. note::

   Charmed OpenStack assumes a backing cloud type of MAAS. This precludes the
   use of the :command:`juju expose` command for opening firewall ports since
   MAAS does not implement a firewall.
